This program simplifies and evaluates algebraic expressions, namely numbers and monomials. This project exists because I wanted 
to design a system using the design recipe in HtDP. I think I have applied it, for the most, unsuccessfully; moreover, I applied
some ideas from SiCP, e.g., data abstraction - constructors and selectors.

Implemented using MIT-Scheme and Emacs.
